### Welcome to my first ever blog post.

> First of all, thank you for taking the time to come visit this blog. This
> actually got started as a weekend experiment on how fast I can learn how
> to build a functioning website using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
> And yes, it is not hard at all thanks to so many dev-friendly features that
> are baked-in to those technologies. Among my favorites are the continuous deployment option via github.
> Which means that once you've deployed your website, you can just save your code changes, push those
> to github. Netlify then takes those changes, reboots and redeploys your website without you having to do anything at all.
> Coolness right?!
> Not only that, Gatsby comes with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) as it's query language and as soon as
> you start your project, you will have access to a graphQL playground where you can make queries to
> all files in your project directory. Add to those the blazing-fast performance and a good amount of starter
> libraries and themes to choose from makes GatsbyJS and Netlify a combination that's hard to ignore.

## So what's this blog space going to be about?

> Well, I'm going to treat this as a place where I can hopefully share my coding journey
> and experiences as a junior developer hunting for that first dev job. This will
> also be a place where I can share some of the cool technology that is out there. And
> as I love cooking, eating, music and cycling, I'll probably throw those in as well!

> It's bare basics for now but I'm going to dig in deeper and add more features to this blog. Let me know
> what you think by sending me an email <mailto:monmaramba@yahoo.com>
